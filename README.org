A hid proxy using ESP32S3. No extra add on boards are needed. Just connect your ESP32 to your computer.

The keyboard connects to the ESP32S3, which acts as a USB HID device to the computer host. The HID commands are relayed over bluetooth to the host computer over USB HID.

This was tested on following keyboards:
- Redragon Bluetooth Keyboards

* Features
- hid proxy for bluetooth keyboard: Scan and connect to BLE keyboards. The code is modified based on the official example: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/bluetooth/esp_hid_host
also, now also using code from
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/peripherals/usb/device/tusb_hid/main/tusb_hid_example_main.c


  Which device will be selected:
  1. UUID is 0x1812 while parsing with ESP_BLE_AD_TYPE_16SRV_PART
  2. Apprearence equals to ESP_BLE_APPEARANCE_HID_KEYBOARD (0x03C1)
  3. The first scanned device will be selected
  4. No authentication is required

- Remember connected keyboard: Use nvs_flash to store one bluetooth device address. Once this is set, hid host will skip other devices.
- LED signals to illustrate connection mode. There are three LED mode:
  - *Rapid blink mode*: Scan for new device.
  - *Slow blink mode*: Scan for known device.
  - *Off*: Connected.
- Relay the keyboard's input to CH9328/CH9329

* Build and flash
Install esp idf: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/index.html

set target to esp32s3

  #+begin_src bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
  #+end_src

Then, build and flash to your hid proxy using serial port dev/ttyUSB0. With monitor, you can start monitor after flashing, use Ctrl-] to stop monitor and release the port.

#+begin_src bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 flash monitor
#+end_src

* Usage
- *Connect to new device*: if no device is stored, esp32c3 will start scanning available keyboards, and led will turn into rapid blink mode. The scanning may take a few seconds. After connecting to the first scanned device, led will tuen into off mode. And the connected device is stored.
- *Connect to known device*: If no device is connected and there exists a bluetooth device address (esp_bd_addr_t) stored in esp32c3's nvs_flash. The LED will try scan this recorded device, and tune led into slow blink mode.
- *Erase known device*: Press the boot button (IO9) for at lease one second, until the led turns into rapid blink mode.

* Known issues
- Crash if the opened keyboard is already connected to another hid_proxy.
- LED mode change delay after pressing the boot button to erase.

* Todos
- Storing multiple devices and swithing with an extra button
- Support ble mouse with ch9329
- Refactor the code to make it more robust
- start a web server for keyboad connecting, this is useful when you have multiple keyboards or need authentication
